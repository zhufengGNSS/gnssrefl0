# gnssrefl0
This package has a new version of my GNSS-IR reflectometry code
Do not use this until I get a chance to confirm that it installs properly.
The main difference bewteen this version and previous versions is that I am
attempting to use proper python packaging. I have separated out the main
parts of the code and the command line inputs so that you can use the libraries
yourself or do it all from the command line. This should also - hopefully - make
it easier for the production of Jupyter notebooks down the road.
